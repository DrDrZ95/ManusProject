# MLflow Integration Guide

## 1. Introduction to MLflow

MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle. Developed by Databricks, it addresses key challenges in ML development, including experiment tracking, reproducibility, and model deployment. MLflow provides a set of tools that help data scientists and machine learning engineers streamline their workflows and collaborate more effectively.

**Key Components of MLflow:**

*   **MLflow Tracking:** Allows you to record and query experiments, including code, data, configuration, and results. It enables you to track parameters, metrics, and artifacts (e.g., models, plots) for each run.
*   **MLflow Projects:** Provides a standard format for packaging ML code in a reusable and reproducible way. This enables sharing of ML code across different platforms and ensures consistent execution.
*   **MLflow Models:** Offers a convention for packaging ML models in a standard format that can be used by various downstream tools (e.g., for real-time serving or batch inference). It supports different flavors of models (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   **MLflow Model Registry:** A centralized model store that allows you to manage the lifecycle of MLflow Models, including versioning, stage transitions (e.g., Staging, Production), and annotations.

## 2. Basic Installation Process

MLflow can be easily installed using `pip`. Before installation, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv mlflow-env
source mlflow-env/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# For Windows: .\mlflow-env\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2: Install MLflow

Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install MLflow using pip:

```bash
pip install mlflow
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

To verify that MLflow has been installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
mlflow --version
```

This should output the installed MLflow version.

### Step 4: Start the MLflow UI (Optional)

MLflow comes with a web-based user interface that allows you to visualize, search, and compare ML runs. To start the UI, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

By default, the MLflow UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. You can then navigate to this URL in your web browser to view your experiments.

### Step 5: Basic Usage Example (Python)

Here's a simple Python example demonstrating how to log parameters and metrics using MLflow Tracking:

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Enable autologging for scikit-learn
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

# Start an MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.01)
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)

    # Train a simple model
    model = LogisticRegression(solver="liblinear", random_state=42)
    # In a real scenario, you would train on actual data
    # For demonstration, we'll just simulate a training process
    # model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Simulate predictions and metrics
    y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
    y_pred = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)

    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)

    # Log the model (optional, autologging might handle this)
    # mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "logistic_regression_model")

    print(f"MLflow Run ID: {mlflow.active_run().info.run_id}")
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

After running this script, you can open the MLflow UI (`mlflow ui`) to see the logged experiment run, including parameters, metrics, and potentially the model artifact.
