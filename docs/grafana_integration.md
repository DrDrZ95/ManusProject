# Grafana Integration Guide

## 1. Introduction to Grafana
Grafana is an open-source data visualization and monitoring tool that allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics, logs, and traces no matter where they are stored. It provides a powerful and elegant way to create dashboards from various data sources, making it a popular choice for operational analytics.

**Key Features:**
*   **Unified Visualization**: Connects with numerous data sources (Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) and allows you to visualize data in a single interface.
*   **Rich Dashboards**: Offers a wide range of visualization options, including graphs, heatmaps, tables, and more, with highly customizable panels.
*   **Alerting**: Define alert rules based on your metrics and receive notifications through various channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.).
*   **Templating**: Use variables in your dashboards to create dynamic and reusable templates, reducing duplication.
*   **Plugins**: Extend functionality with a rich ecosystem of community-built and official plugins for data sources, panels, and apps.

## 2. Basic Installation of Grafana
This guide outlines the basic steps to install Grafana on a Linux system. For other operating systems or more advanced deployments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), please refer to the official Grafana documentation.

### Prerequisites
*   A Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
*   `wget` or `curl` for downloading files
*   `apt` or `yum` package manager

### Step-by-Step Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)

1.  **Install Required Packages**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https software-properties-common wget
    ```

2.  **Import the GPG Key**
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
    sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.key https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key
    ```

3.  **Add Grafana Repository**
    ```bash
    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.key] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
    ```

4.  **Update Apt Cache**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

5.  **Install Grafana**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install grafana
    ```

6.  **Start and Enable Grafana Service**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl start grafana-server
    sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
    ```

7.  **Verify Grafana Status**
    Check the status of the Grafana service.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status grafana-server
    ```
    You should see `active (running)`. You can access the Grafana UI in your web browser at `http://<your_server_ip>:3000`. The default login credentials are `admin`/`admin`. You will be prompted to change the password on your first login.

This completes the basic installation of Grafana. You can now configure data sources (like Prometheus) and build dashboards to visualize your metrics.
